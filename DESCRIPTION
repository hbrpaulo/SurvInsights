Description: This dataset contains minimal clinical records for survival
    prediction of sepsis patients. It includes 110,204 admissions of
    84,811 hospitalized individuals in Norway from 2011â€“2012, diagnosed
    with infections, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis
    (Sepsis-3), or septic shock. The prediction task is to determine
    patient survival approximately 9 days after hospital admission, using
    only age, sex, and sepsis episode count. The dataset includes three
    cohorts: primary (Norway), study (subset of primary cohort defined by
    Sepsis-3), and an external validation cohort (South Korea). This
    minimal-feature dataset enables rapid and interpretable clinical
    modeling.
