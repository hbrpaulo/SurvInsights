The CSV files in this directory are small excerpts from the data published alongside the article *"Survival prediction of patients with sepsis from age, sex, and septic episode number alone"* (Sci Rep 2020, doi:10.1038/s41598-020-73558-3). They include only the variables `age_years`, `sex_0male_1female`, `episode_number` and `hospital_outcome_1alive_0dead` and are intended solely for package examples.
